pun-gen
=======

Description: 
  PunGen is a program in which you type a word, say, gravity, and then the program finds the pun associated with that keyword, in this case being "I read a book about anti-gravity; I just couldn't put it down!" 
  
  Updates:
  
  6/16/14: Beta 1: Added a pretty background image to our program.  Also, extended the list of puns (still small).
